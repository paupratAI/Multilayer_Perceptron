# Practice 1: Multilayer Perceptron

## Introduction
This project corresponds to the first practice of the course Neural Networks and Deep Learning for the Bachelor's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). In this work, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was developed to predict smartphone prices based on their features.

## Project Structure
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A statistical study was conducted to understand the variables, identify patterns and anomalies, and analyze correlations between variables.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, identifying and managing outliers, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and normalizing numerical variables.
3. **Baseline Linear Model**: A linear regression model was implemented as a starting point to evaluate improvements with more complex models.
4. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Development and evaluation of various MLP models with different hyperparameter configurations to find the optimal model.
5. **Model Comparison**: Comparison of results obtained with the linear model, Random Forest, and different MLPs developed.
6. **Conclusions**: Analysis of the obtained results, reflections on the preprocessing process, and the importance of hyperparameters in deep learning models.

## Results
The selected multilayer perceptron model demonstrated superior predictive capability compared to the linear regression model and Random Forest. The results indicate that the MLP with a multi-layer architecture and careful hyperparameter tuning provides more accurate and robust predictions.
